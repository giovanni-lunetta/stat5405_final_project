## Abstract

This study utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and XGBoost, to predict yards gained by NFL running backs after a handoff. Employing player tracking data from the 2017 to 2019 seasons, the models will consider player positions, velocities, accelerations, and game context. The goal is to provide actionable insights for team strategy and player utilization, contributing to the field of sports analytics.

## Goal/Motivation

The goal is to develop predictive models that accurately estimate yards gained by a running back after a handoff, aiding team strategies and player evaluations in NFL games.

The motivation for this study is rooted in the increasing relevance of data-driven decisions in sports. By translating player tracking data into actionable insights, this research aims to enhance team performance and contribute to sports analytics.

## Methods

**Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**: We will use MLR as our baseline model to establish initial relationships between the predictor variables and the target outcome.

**Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**: GLM will allow us to capture potential non-linear interactions and complex relationships in the data.

**XGBoost**: As an advanced ensemble method, XGBoost will be used to model complex patterns in the high-dimensional data, aiming for improved accuracy and robustness.

Data preprocessing will be a crucial initial step, involving handling of missing values, feature normalization, and variable engineering. Feature selection will be conducted to identify the most influential variables, and model performance will be evaluated.

## Data

The data is from NFL games played during the 2017, 2018, and the first half of the 2019 seasons.

Each row in the file corresponds to a single player's involvement in a single play. All the columns are contained in one large dataframe which is grouped and provided by PlayId.

Here are the columns:

`GameId` - a unique game identifier

`PlayId` - a unique play identifier

`Team` - home or away

`X` - player position along the long axis of the field. See figure below.

`Y` - player position along the short axis of the field. See figure below.

`S` - speed in yards/second

`A` - acceleration in yards/second^2

`Dis` - distance traveled from prior time point, in yards

`Orientation` - orientation of player (deg)

`Dir` - angle of player motion (deg)

`NflId` - a unique identifier of the player

`DisplayName` - player's name

`JerseyNumber` - jersey number

`Season` - year of the season

`YardLine` - the yard line of the line of scrimmage

`Quarter` - game quarter (1-5, 5 == overtime)

`GameClock` - time on the game clock

`PossessionTeam` - team with possession

`Down` - the down (1-4)

`Distance` - yards needed for a first down

`FieldPosition` - which side of the field the play is happening on

`HomeScoreBeforePlay` - home team score before play started

`VisitorScoreBeforePlay` - visitor team score before play started

`NflIdRusher` - the NflId of the rushing player

`OffenseFormation` - offense formation

`OffensePersonnel` - offensive team positional grouping

`DefendersInTheBox` - number of defenders lined up near the line of scrimmage, spanning the width of the offensive line

`DefensePersonnel` - defensive team positional grouping

`PlayDirection` - direction the play is headed

`TimeHandoff` - UTC time of the handoff

`TimeSnap` - UTC time of the snap

`Yards` - the yardage gained on the play (you are predicting this)

`PlayerHeight` - player height (ft-in)

`PlayerWeight` - player weight (lbs)

`PlayerBirthDate` - birth date (mm/dd/yyyy)

`PlayerCollegeName` - where the player attended college

`Position` - the player's position (the specific role on the field that they typically play)

`HomeTeamAbbr` - home team abbreviation

`VisitorTeamAbbr` - visitor team abbreviation

`Week` - week into the season

`Stadium` - stadium where the game is being played

`Location` - city where the game is being played

`StadiumType` - description of the stadium environment

`Turf` - description of the field surface

`GameWeather` - description of the game weather

`Temperature` - temperature (deg F)

`Humidity` - humidity

`WindSpeed` - wind speed in miles/hour

`WindDirection` - wind direction

There are 682154 rows and 49 columns.
